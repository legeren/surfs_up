## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to retrieve temperature information and summary temperature statistics for the months of June and December.  The data will help inform W.Avy on whether surf and ice cream shop is a sustainable year-round business.

## Results: 
1.  Very little difference in max temperature between June (85) and December (83).
2.  Summer month (June) is generally warmer but the average temperature is only varying by ~4 degrees between the two months (June at 74.9 and December at 71.0)
3.  December minimum temperature (56) seem to dip much lower (varying by ~8 degrees) compared to June (64).

## Summary: 
***High-level summary***
Based on the results for temperature data from June and December, there is little fluctuation in temperature between the two months over the years' worth of data included in the analysis.  This means that, basing on temperature alone, surf and ice cream shop could be a sustainable year-round business.

***Additional queries***
1. I would include precipitation information in the analysis as this might affect whether people stay indoors and away from surfing/ice cream shops.
2. Another data point would be to check hourly temperature for the months of June and December.  It is possible that temperatures might fluctuate during the day and there might only be some peak hours when W.Avy can take advantage of business for his surf and ice cream shop.
